A place to publish the different types I make for Python. 

Currently just contains a couple of interesting list types, but will be 
expanded in future as and when needed.

List of types
-------------

InterpoList: a list which does automatic interpolation between given numerical 
    values, for example:
        >>> a = InterpoList()
        >>> a[0]   = 0
        >>> a[100] = 200
        >>> a[200] = 0
        >>> a[50]
        100.0
        >>> a[125]
        150.0

    Currently only supports linear interpolation, but it would be relatively
    easy to add different types in future.

RandomList: a lazily shuffled list of integers.

Timestamper: Wraps around a FIFO queue, timestamping each entry as it is added.
